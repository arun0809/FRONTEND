    <u><h2 style="color:black;font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;font-size: 20px;">About:</h2></u>
    <p style="font-size: 15px;font-family: cursive;text-indent: 70px;">Nike as a brand plays a key role in today’s sports and athletics apparel and equipment industry. Since Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman established the company under a partnership in the year 1962, it has progressed a lot. The brands’ target market has consistently been the youthful especially the males who are the key purchasers of the company’s sportswear. Reebok being Nikes main competitor brand has positioned itself strategically to increase its niche market in the industry market share. Nike has had several celebrities endorsing its brand such as Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods’ among others and this enhances the marketability of the company’s products (Park, 1994). The company has also been able to grow tremendously and achieve the highest market share in the global market through its aggressive marketing strategies, the innovation of new products as well as the superior production of its products. The company’s turnover has consistently grown and therefore generating a lot of revenue.</p>

On the other hand, consumers and the business expatriates are of the view that the brand Nike is highly respected. It is important to note that in today’s market the Nike branding initiative is not only confined only to consumer products that are packaged for use but also it plays a significant role in all its departments in the organization.

        The brand’s evolution
        
        Founded under a partnership in 1962 by Phil knight and bill bowerman the Nike Company was initially known as the “blue ribbon sports.” Then the company’s ultimate goal was to supply to the American consumers high quality and low cost Japanese sports shoes’ as to break Germany’s monopoly in that industry. The first shipment was made in 1962 and 200 pairs of shoes were received. In 1971 the company started manufacturing its own soccer shoes which later on bore the name of the Nike brand with the swoosh trademark. There was a breakup in the tiger relationship in 1972 but a new deal was signed with Jordan in 1980, which led to the company’s growth and expansion (Park, 1994).</p>
